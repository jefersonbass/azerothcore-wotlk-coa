# In-game reports to GitHub

The existing Ascension Help UI submits local-realm reports to
`jealous-sound/azerothcore-wotlk-coa`. The adapter applies only to the exact realm
`AzerothCore`. Other realms retain the original submit, events and link actions.

The local relay forwards reports to `https://coa-bug-report.up.railway.app/v1/reports`.
The GitHub token stays in Railway. The distributed relay includes the separately
configured intake API key, which grants access only to this report endpoint. The key
ships in this public repository (`apps/coa-bugreport/relay.py`), so treat it as public.
The feature is off by default (`CoABugReport.Enable = 0`); deployment must enable it.

## Player experience

Open Help → Bug Report and fill in the existing category, severity, title,
description, expected/actual results and reproduction fields. Press **Send to GitHub**.
The form names the repository and explains that repository readers can see reports.
The original public/private checkbox is hidden locally: GitHub repository visibility
determines access, and this feature does not offer private issues in a public repository.

The server acknowledges a saved report first. The form displays **GitHub issue #N
created** and a copyable GitHub URL only after the relay confirms creation. A queue
acknowledgement, timeout or ambiguous response is not displayed as success.

The payload includes all category fields (including spell/item identifiers where
the selected layout provides them), selected severity and client version. The server
adds class ID, level, map, coordinates and core Git revision. It does not automatically
publish account IDs, character names, IP addresses, chat logs, credentials or saved settings.
The core hash does not describe uncommitted source changes; retain the deployment receipt
when diagnosing a locally modified build. Text explicitly typed into the form is submitted.

One outstanding report is kept in `CoABugReportDB`, a normal account SavedVariables
table. A normal logout/reload saves this draft; a client crash before that save can lose
an unacknowledged draft. A completed upload is already on the server and does not depend
on the client remaining open. Reopening the form resumes/checks the same request ID.

## Components

The client adapter is supplied separately in the matching client overlay. Its
archive member is
`Interface/AddOns/Ascension_HelpUI/BugReport/LocalGitHubBugReport.lua`.
`Ascension_HelpUI.toc` declares its SavedVariables and loads it after the original
frames.

Server and relay paths below are relative to the repository root:

- `src/server/coa/CoABugReport.cpp`: authenticated self-whisper receiver registered by `CoAScriptLoader.cpp`.
- `src/server/coa/CoABugReportService.h`: bounded upload protocol, persistent queue and status lookup.
- `apps/coa-bugreport/relay.py`: a separate Python 3.10+ process using only the standard library.
- `src/server/coa/conf/coa_bugreport.conf.dist`: disabled startup configuration.

Messages use the `COABUG` addon prefix, 180-byte chunks and stop-and-wait acknowledgements.
The full message fits the core's 255-byte limit. Chunk boundaries may split UTF-8;
the receiver reassembles bytes before the relay validates UTF-8. Reports are limited
to 12,000 bytes, including a title of 3–200 bytes. Idle uploads expire after 120 seconds;
there are at most 128 partial uploads. The receiver limits protocol requests to 24 per
second per authenticated account and defaults to one submitted report per 120 seconds.
Account limits survive relogging but reset on worldserver restart.

The complete request is written to a temporary file, flushed/closed, then renamed to
`<account>-<request>.report`. The relay ignores partial files. These are private service
files: their filenames contain account IDs, which are not included in GitHub issues.
The game server performs no HTTP calls, holds no GitHub credential and creates no new
game database tables. The small amount of local file I/O happens in the world-thread
chat hook; keep the spool on a local disk, not a network share.

## Activation after an explicitly authorized build

1. Build the matching server sources with the CoA loader entry and C++
   receiver, preserving the other class implementations. Install the matching
   server and client overlay together.
2. Create a private local spool directory outside the source checkout, accessible
   only to the worldserver and relay service identities. Grant those identities
   read/write access; do not expose the directory through a web server or
   distribute it to players.
3. Install `coa_bugreport.conf` from the dist template into the server's module config
   directory. Set `CoABugReport.Enable = 1` and `CoABugReport.SpoolDirectory` to the
   absolute directory above. These settings are read at startup, not on config reload.
4. Deploy the `jealous-sound/coa-bug-report` service on Railway with
   `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `REPORT_API_KEY`. The GitHub credential needs issue creation
   access to the fixed target repository and stays in Railway's environment.
   Set the same intake key in the distributed relay, or override its bundled value
   with `COA_BUGREPORT_API_KEY`. Players do not need GitHub accounts.
   The Railway service needs no persistent volume or database.
5. Start the worker from the repository root, preferably supervised by the
   server service manager. Replace `<absolute-spool-directory>` with the same
   absolute path configured in `CoABugReport.SpoolDirectory`. This command
   enables real issue creation:

   ```powershell
   $bugReportSpool = "<absolute-spool-directory>"
   python -B "apps/coa-bugreport/relay.py" --spool $bugReportSpool --send
   ```

   Without `--send`, the command only validates current `.report` files, then exits;
   it does not read the intake key, contact Railway or write a journal. `--once --send` processes
   one pass, respecting any persisted delay; it does not drain a rate-limited queue.
6. Package the matching TOC and adapter into a new overlay on the **current**
   B archive. Verify changed member hashes and preservation of the realm-card
   and character-creation changes. Synchronize with the client closed.
   Client test launches require explicit authorization.

The repository destination is fixed in the adapter and relay. Changing it requires a
coordinated source/configuration review; a player cannot choose an API URL or repository.
Existing draft SavedVariables are created by normal client use, not by the installer.

The relay sends title/body only to the fixed Railway endpoint: no player-controlled
destination, assignees, labels or issue-management actions. The service neutralizes
`@` mentions before publishing. Both HTTP clients refuse redirects. The intake key
is sent only to Railway; only Railway sends the GitHub credential to GitHub.

## Delivery and recovery

The local relay uses a SQLite journal with committed intent before each POST, atomic
status files and one OS-locked worker per spool. This journal lives on the game server's
existing local disk; it requires no Railway storage. Repeated submissions with the same
request ID return the original queued report or issue.

Railway also filters identical normalized title/body content in memory for up to 24 hours
or 4,096 records. It reserves content while an upload is in flight, so simultaneous clicks
cannot create the same issue twice in that process. It returns HTTP 202 while a matching
request is pending and returns the original issue after completion. It never queries GitHub
to find duplicates. Restarting/redeploying Railway resets this content cache; reports with
different content, including different server context, remain separate reports.

Successful issue creation stores the number before publishing the status file. After
a restart, a missing status file can be rebuilt from the journal without another POST.
Network calls do not block game threads. Rate limits and definite permission failures
pause delivery. The worker spaces requests at least five seconds apart and honors the
service's `Retry-After` header. Known pending requests are retried through the same content
filter. Invalid requests become `failed`; service authentication or definite repository
access failures become `blocked` and can recover after configuration is repaired.

An ambiguous timeout, 5xx response, malformed success response or interrupted `posting`
journal entry becomes `uncertain`. Neither component searches GitHub. The relay does not
automatically resend an uncertain report, because Railway's duplicate cache can reset.
An administrator must check the exact report and repository before repairing its local
journal/receipt. No automatic force-resend command is provided. The journal retains its
legacy opaque marker column for compatibility, but markers are not added to issue bodies
or used for network requests. Detailed API responses and credentials never reach the addon.

Keep `.report`, `.status` and `relay.sqlite3` together and back them up. Do not delete the
journal to clear an error: that discards duplicate protection. Completed records are retained;
automatic retention/archival and cross-machine failover are outside this implementation.
Atomic publication covers normal process crashes/restarts; abrupt disk or power failure is
not a claim of transactional durability across the game server, filesystem and GitHub.

## Verification

Earlier offline validation exercised the real Lua 5.1 adapter, a small executable using
the actual protocol header, and the previous direct-GitHub relay. Those historical checks
do not validate the new Railway transport. The relay fixtures were updated for Railway,
but were not run, following the owner's request to proceed to deployment without local tests.
Read-only checks of the deployed service confirmed health, rejection without an intake key
and authenticated method handling with the configured key. They did not submit a report.

Standalone relay tests need only Python. Run from the repository root:

```powershell
python -B apps/coa-tests/bugreport/test_relay.py
```

Earlier actual-source MSVC `/Zs` checks covered `CoABugReport.cpp` and `CoAScriptLoader.cpp`
against native project headers. Build and installation receipts are deployment-specific.
Offline checks do not establish rendered UI, live packet delivery or successful issue creation.

Live acceptance must exercise the normal Help entry point, all category fields, a normal
player account, successful creation/link copy, close/reopen during delivery and normal
relog. Confirm the issue in the target repository. Deliberate outage tests should use a
controlled worker fixture or stopped worker, and preserve the request/journal for recovery.

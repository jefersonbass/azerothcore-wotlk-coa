 * mod-treasure-keeper - CoA's bank companions, the Treasure Keeper and the Celestial Treasure
 * Keeper: non-combat pets whose right click opens the character's own bank.
 *
 * Both are ordinary companions of this realm's pattern - an item whose on-use spell (55884) hands
 * out a summon spell, and the summon spell is a plain guardian:
 *
 *     item 98073 "Celestial Treasure Keeper" -> spell 93417  -> creature 80918  (display 47857)
 *     item 99491 "Treasure Keeper"           -> spell 985356 -> creature 10111377 (display 48611)
 *
 * Their own text is the whole specification:
 *
 *     "Right Click to summon and dismiss your companion, that acts as a portable bank while in
 *      safe zones. Cannot be summoned in High-Risk Open World."
 *
 * The bank they open is the *native* one - not this realm's personal/realm banks, which are
 * summoned vault objects handled elsewhere (mod-ascension-compat's AscensionPersonalBank). No
 * code is needed for it: the pets carry UNIT_NPC_FLAG_BANKER (0x20000) and the core answers the
 * client's own click (CMSG_BANKER_ACTIVATE 0x01B7 -> WorldSession::HandleBankerActivateOpcode ->
 * Player::GetNPCIfCanInteractWith(guid, UNIT_NPC_FLAG_BANKER) -> SendShowBank), which is a path
 * that already allows a player's own pet or guardian.
 *
 * What this module adds is what data cannot express:
 *
 *   * the summon restriction and the use restriction. "High-Risk Open World" is the character
 *     ruleset this fork keeps in mod-ascension-compat/src/AscensionRulesets.cpp: High-Risk is aura
 *     1004019, War Mode is aura 1004119, and PvE is that same War Mode aura *plus* the marker
 *     9931032 - which is how the client tells the two apart. So the states stay separate here as
 *     they are on the client: War Mode and High-Risk refuse the companion, PvE keeps it. The
 *     refusal speaks with the item's own wording instead of the client's generic cast error, and
 *     each half can be switched off where an operator wants it allowed. A *city* is exempt
 *     altogether, because a city is not "Open World" and this realm's own PvP rulesets cannot reach
 *     a character inside one - see InCity.
 *   * the refusal lines go to the middle of the screen as well as to the chat log, on the realm's
 *     own notification opcode, so the reason is read where the player is looking - see SendNotice.
 *   * the click. A companion keeps its banker flag in every ruleset, so it is always right-clickable
 *     and the click can be *answered*: with the reason when the ruleset forbids it. A companion
 *     serves whoever clicks it, and the window the core opens is the clicker's own bank, so a keeper
 *     another player has out is theirs too - under the same rules, read from the clicker. That is
 *     what PlayerScript::OnPlayerBankerActivate (PLAYERHOOK_ON_BANKER_ACTIVATE) is for - the one
 *     place the native bank window can be withheld, called from the core's own handler before it
 *     resolves the click.
 *   * the readiness report at startup, because every way this companion can be wrong is silent:
 *     without the banker flag a click produces no packet at all, and the display the pets use
 *     carries a 3.5x client model scale (CreatureDisplayInfo.dbc) that an un-countered server
 *     scale turns into a giant. Both are data, and both are in the SQL next door.
 *
 * Deliberately not done here: a second bank window. The core's own handler is the single
 * implementation of "open the native bank", and this module only ever says no to it - a second open
 * would be a second opinion about the same character, exactly as a hand-built trainer window would
 * be for the books.

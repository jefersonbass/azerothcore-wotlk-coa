# mod-coa-challenges

AzerothCore (WotLK) module that reimplements the Conquest of Azeroth
**challenges/trials** system server-side: the client's `C_Challenge` UI is
driven entirely by data already present in the game client patch, while this
module supplies the **authority** (activation gates, auras, lives, rules,
objectives, completions, rewards and the Gamemodes state).

> Status: functional and validated live for activation, death/fail, auras,
> lives, shared fate, hunger/fatigue, rules, activation conditions, criteria
> banners, leaderboard, trial creator and reward delivery. See *Scope* below.

## Requirements

- AzerothCore WotLK, branch `coa-challenge-defs` (or `main`) of the CoA fork.
- **Companion core opcode entries** in `src/server/game/Server/Protocol/Opcodes.h`
  (the "CoA extension range" block) — the module uses custom opcodes.
- The **`mod-ascension-compat`** module (opcode pass-through).
- The game client patch that ships the `Challenge*.dbc` files and the challenges
  UI addon (definitions + UI live there, not here).
- For achievements: the client `Achievement.dbc` installed in the server
  `Data/dbc` (custom achievement ids exceed the stock range;
  `Achievement_Criteria.dbc` / `Achievement_Category.dbc` stay stock). Because
  the ids exceed `uint16`, the core `AchievementMgr::LoadFromDB` must read
  `character_achievement.achievement` as `uint32` (the module widens the column;
  see the CoA fork), otherwise completions are dropped on relog.

## Layout

```
mod-coa-challenges.cmake          registers helper headers + unit tests
conf/
  mod-coa-challenges.conf.dist    tunables (see "Configuration")
data/sql/
  db-characters/                  character-side schema (versioned)
  db-world/                       challenge definitions schema (versioned)
src/
  CoA.Challenges.*.cpp / Review.h     implementation, split by area
  CoAChallengeParse.h                 pure parsing/matching (host-testable)
  CoAChallengeInternal.h              GM/test-only declarations
  CoAChallengeTests.cpp               in-game e2e/GM harness
tests/
  CoAChallengeParseTest.cpp           host unit tests (core `unit_tests`)
```

## Installation

1. Place the module at `modules/mod-coa-challenges`.
2. Apply the companion core opcode block (see *Requirements*).
3. Reconfigure and build AzerothCore.
4. Copy/keep `conf/*.conf.dist` as `.conf` and tune as needed.

The character and world tables are created by the versioned SQL under `data/sql/`
(applied automatically by the AzerothCore DB updater). On a dev box without the
updater, set `CoAChallenges.AutoCreateSchema = 1` to create them at runtime.

## Data flow

- **Definitions** (rules, conditions, objectives, auras, lives, rewards) originate
  from an **export of the game client** and are imported into the **world
  database** (`coa_challenge_definition`, `coa_challenge_spell`,
  `coa_challenge_reward`) via the generated SQL
  (`coa-analyze-export.ps1 -EmitSql`). The world DB is the single source of
  truth; the module reads it into a memory cache at startup and on
  `.coa challenges reload`.
- **Rewards** are delivered **by mail** on completion. The client only *displays*
  the reward definition; it never sends a "claim". See the Rewards notes in
  `conf/mod-coa-challenges.conf.dist`.
- The **Challenges Store** tab (Trial Masters / Build Masters) is a separate,
  100% server-side Custom Store system and is **out of scope** for this module.

## Configuration

All options are documented inline in `conf/mod-coa-challenges.conf.dist`,
grouped by area: UI tabs, game modes, lifecycle, rewards, announcements/client
state, grouping, hunger/thirst, fatigue, professions and testing.

Any key omitted from a customized `.conf` falls back to the code default; new
keys are appended automatically on deploy.

## GM / admin commands

```
.coa <trial|challenge> <unlock|check> <id> [player]
.coa e2e <player> <id> [intervalMs]
.coa reward <id> [level] [player]
.coa challenges reload
.coa reset [all] <player>
```

## Scope / limitations

- GroupRewards (`ChallengeGroupRewards.dbc`) — semantics not confirmed.
- Custom Store (Trial Masters tab) — separate system, not implemented here.
- Some rules/objectives/conditions are still being mapped; the module applies
  the subset described in `conf/mod-coa-challenges.conf.dist`.

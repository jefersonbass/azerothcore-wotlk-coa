 * Worldforged pickups - the CoA world object that hands out a Worldforged base item,
 * which every character may loot once and then never again.
 *
 * The data (Database/Custom/worldforged-pickups.sql) restores the pickups themselves:
 * 1,555 objects - bags, buckets, bones, packets, caches - each one named after the base
 * item it holds, each holding exactly that item, spawned at the position the community
 * observed that object at. Two deliberate deviations from the captures support the rule:
 *
 *   * chest.consumable = 0, so a pickup stays spawned after it is emptied instead of
 *     despawning on a respawn timer (which would make it a realm-wide roll per respawn).
 *     The core already re-rolls a non-consumable chest's loot for the next opener:
 *     Player::SendLoot clears and fills while the object is GO_READY, and
 *     GameObject::Update returns it to GO_READY after a loot is released.
 *   * ScriptName 'worldforged_pickup', the marker this module keys on. The captures have
 *     an empty ScriptName.
 *
 * This module supplies what data cannot: the per-character, permanent memory.
 *
 *   * 'looted' is remembered per (character, spawn) in the characters database table
 *     character_worldforged_loot and in memory for the session.
 *   * The ledger is read in Player::LoadFromDB, not on login. This matters: the core
 *     sends a player the gameobjects around them before CharacterHandler calls
 *     OnPlayerLogin, so a ledger loaded that late arrives after the client has already
 *     been told the pickup is sparkling and lootable - and nothing corrects it, because
 *     the object's own state never changes. Loading during LoadFromDB is early enough
 *     that the first values update a player receives already carries the right flags.
 *   * A pickup the character already looted stays in the world - as it does on the realm -
 *     but is inert for that character alone: no sparkle, not selectable, not interactable
 *     (GameObjectAI::BuildClientFlags). Every other character still sees it sparkling.
 *   * A pickup the character may still loot sparkles
 *     (GO_DYNFLAG_LO_ACTIVATE | GO_DYNFLAG_LO_SPARKLE), which is how they are found.
 *
 * Server-side the same rule is enforced in four places, because a client can always ask
 * again and the four answer different questions:
 *
 *   1. GameObjectAI::BuildClientFlags - what this viewer is shown.
 *   2. GameObjectAI::GossipHello - whether the use opens anything at all. GameObject::Use
 *      is not even reached for a viewer carrying GO_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE.
 *   3. OnAllowedForPlayerLootCheck (worldforged_pickup_loot_veto below) - whether this
 *      character may be handed the item, asked per item, at the moment of the award. This
 *      is the one that closes the door on a loot session that outlived its claim: the
 *      chest holds one shared Loot, so the next character's open re-rolls it under the
 *      first character's still-open window, and StoreLootItem would otherwise hand over a
 *      second copy to whoever clicks the slot first.
 *   4. GameObjectAI::OnStateChanged - repairs a pickup left GO_ACTIVATED with spent loot
 *      (someone closed the loot window by logging out), which would otherwise show the
 *      next character an empty window instead of their own item.
 *
 * The award itself and the record of it are one write: the item row, its place in the
 * inventory and the ledger row go into a single character-database transaction, so a crash
 * can leave neither rather than a claimed pickup whose item was never saved.
 *
 * Identity: a pickup is recorded by its *spawn id* (the `gameobject`.`guid` row), never by
 * the runtime object GUID. This core hands out map-local generated GUIDs
 * (Map::GenerateLowGuid), so a runtime GUID is neither the database row nor stable across
 * grid reloads - keying on it would lose or invent history. The restoration writes its
 * spawns in a fixed guid block, so the ids are stable across re-imports too.

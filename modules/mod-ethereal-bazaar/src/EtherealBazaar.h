/*
 * Tiraxis and the Ethereal Bazaar.
 *
 * Tiraxis stood in every Auction House and sold cosmetics for Bazaar Tokens
 * from a stock that changed several times a day. The server that ran him is
 * gone; what survives is the client's own description of him, his item pool,
 * and a capture of the fixed part of his inventory. This module rebuilds the
 * vendor from that.
 *
 * Three things are kept apart, because they behave differently:
 *
 *   The BAZAAR rotates. A timer redraws the stock from a pool of roughly four
 *   thousand vanity items, a fixed number of slots per price band.
 *
 *   CONVENIENCE is fixed. Scrolls, bags, tomes, potions - the same list every
 *   day, straight out of npc_vendor.
 *
 *   LOST CACHES are fixed too. One per vanity category, each holding a random
 *   item that used to be webshop-only and has no other source left.
 *
 * All three hang off one creature and one gossip menu.
 * WorldSession::SendListInventory takes a vendor entry, so a single NPC can
 * open three different lists without three visible NPCs standing around.

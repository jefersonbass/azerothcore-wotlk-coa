/*
 * Worldforged upgrades: the Guardian of Time and his two custom stores.
 *
 * A Worldforged item can be traded up: hand in the base item plus Runes of
 * Ascension and get the next rank back. The window this ran in is not an
 * ordinary vendor frame. Ascension's client ships its own `RPGItemStore`,
 * driven by a small protocol of its own, and that protocol is what this module
 * speaks. No client patch is involved: the frame, the two store ids and the
 * currency it displays are all already in the client.
 *
 * What the client brings, and where it is written down:
 *
 *   Interface/SharedXML/Enum.lua      Enum.CustomStores.RPGWeaponStore = 8,
 *                                     RPGArmorStore = 9
 *   Interface/FrameXML/HeirloomStore  RPGItemStoreMixin, item 375250 as the
 *                                     visible currency
 *   Interface/FrameXML/CustomVendor   the list, the filter, the purchase
 *                                     confirmation, and the field order of one
 *                                     store record
 *
 * The item pairs come from ItemAddon.dbc: column f40 of an upgraded variant
 * holds the id of its base item. 1738 first-rank upgrades survive that way and
 * every row of both sides already exists in item_template.
 *
 * The prices do not survive. They are computed in the SQL generator and kept in
 * a column of their own, so a real capture can replace them without touching
 * any code.
